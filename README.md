## OCP Cluster Bootstrap for ACM, GitOps and ZTP
Welcome to my GitHub repository!

This repository serves as the baseline for my lab, encompassing various experiments and setups. Here, you'll find a collection of tools and scripts that form the foundation for my OpenShift testing.

## Prerequisite
The KVM host is running with [CentOS 9-Stream](https://cloud.centos.org/centos/9-stream/x86_64/images/). 

## Ansible playbooks
Four playbooks are included. 

| Playbook | Description|
| ---- | --- | 
| baremetal_setup_playbook.yaml | This playbook will install and configure libvirt and sushy on the KVM host|
| registry_vm_setup_playbook.yaml | This playbook will launch CentOS VM for the private registry with 500GB disk size on the KVM host.|
| registry_setup_playbook.yaml | This playbook will install mirror-registry into the registry VM with self-signed cert. |
| vm_setup_playbook.yaml | This playbook will launch Openshift cluster based on the image generated by Agent-based-installer. |

Currently I have modifications and manual steps between playbooks in order to make the setup generic and simplified. However, as the lab evolves, my intention is to automate these manual steps to improve reproducibility and eliminate human error.
